# Lightning-Meter-Detector
An analog meter for lightning

Based on a fully discrete design this meter can detect lightning with a range of approx. 60km on full sensitivity.
The LC circuit is tuned to 178 kHz with an inductor wound on an AM radio ferrite rod.
Bias trim is set at about 100uA on the meter, this doubles as an "ON" indicator.
